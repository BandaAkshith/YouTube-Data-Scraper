[Lyrics]

DAN DADAN DAN DADAN DAN DADAN DAN DADAN...

These guys won't easily give up
You won't be able to compete with them even if you gang up
Kuwabara, Kuwabara, while I pray for safety, they move at a blinding speed
They're immortal, never silent, won't back down, pushing us with selfish greed
Get out of my way; you're in my way; I'm the other you indeed
Packed with ghosts like Sada-chan and Kaya-chan, this land of the dead is a wonderland
Sorry to interrupt your prayers, but when 4:44 rolls around
4 Japanese foot 4 Japanese sun 4 bu tall, coming at you, bang around
If you hear a voice calling, you're haunted all around

I'm inside, I'm inside, I'm inside, I'm inside, I'm inside
The fog lifted as I crawled desperately out
When uneven elements fit well together
When the pain overlaps each other

Heart, body and mind
Overflowing somehow
If there were wings on our backs, now
I'll say goodbye to darkness anyhow
Far away, we'll fly away
Heart, body and mind
And the nostalgic warmth
If flowers bloomed at our feet now
I'll say goodbye to darkness anyhow
Far away, we'll fly away
I'll live again and again
Inside him, or inside you
Behind those eyelids and inside those ears
In the melody and rhythm that haunts deep down the heart for many years
DAN DADAN DAN DADAN DAN DADAN DAN DADAN...

Again, today, in the middle of the banks of hell
Piling up the stones to the top of top
Sword fight with the demons
the lyrical chainsaw massacre
Crossing the open sea
Singin’ to myself, sha-la-la
If you need purification, bring stacks of bills till the end of time(okay?)

Someone opened the Pandora's box, I don't care about what will happen next

It's been a while; I've waited a few hundred years for this free world
Beginners and kids
Don't come this way yet, you stupid
I'm pretty sure we just made eye contact
So, this is what you wanted to show us, Shyamalan

I'm inside, I'm inside, I'm inside, I'm inside, I'm inside
I got tired of sleeping, and there you were, waiting for me
When contradictory elements hug each other's shoulders
When the anger fades away

Heart, body and mind
Overflowing somehow
If there were feathers on our backs, now
I'll say goodbye to darkness anyhow
Far away, we'll fly away
Heart, body and mind
And the nostalgic warmth
If flowers bloomed at our feet now
I'll say goodbye to darkness anyhow
Far away, we'll fly away
I'll live again and again
Inside him, or inside you
Behind those eyelids and inside those ears
In the melody and rhythm that haunts deep down the heart for many years

DAN DADAN DAN DADAN DAN DADAN DAN DADAN...

🌻 Good morning friends, how is your day going?
📺 Are you looking for relaxation, positivity and energy for the new day? This will be the perfect place for you!

📌 The video begins with an exterior shot of a cozy Christmas cafe, glowing warmly against the backdrop of a snowy winter night. Gentle snowflakes fall softly, creating a serene, magical atmosphere. Inside, the smooth sounds of jazz Christmas music fill the air, perfectly complementing the inviting ambience. At the heart of the cafe is a plush red sofa set, accented with festive pillows, placed prominently in the center of the room. Across from the sofa, a traditional brick fireplace crackles with a warm, comforting glow. Beside it stands a beautifully adorned Christmas tree, sparkling with LED lights, gold and silver ornaments, and elegant garlands.

🎄 Near the fireplace, a charming wooden coffee bar features a sleek espresso machine, steaming mugs, candles, and a vase of fresh flowers. The bar is surrounded by a few high stools, offering a cozy nook for guests to enjoy their drinks. Looking from inside the cafe to the outside, the snowy outdoors comes into view—a tranquil lake reflecting the glow of small wooden cabins on the far shore, completing the picturesque winter wonderland.

🌻 Good morning friends, how is your day going?
📺 Are you looking for relaxation, positivity and energy for the new day? This will be the perfect place for you!

📌 The Jazz Piano music video is set in a cozy fall coffee shop. A comfortable sofa set is placed in the middle of the floor, offering a warm and inviting atmosphere. Nearby, a fireplace crackles softly, filling the space with gentle warmth and a sense of relaxation. Behind the sofa, an indoor café space adds to the intimate feel, with soft lighting and a peaceful ambience. From the cafe, you can gaze out at the serene autumn morning by the lakeside. Golden leaves fall gently from the trees, while the flowers and trees sway softly in the cool autumn breeze, creating a picturesque and tranquil scene. The natural beauty of the outdoors blends harmoniously with the cozy indoor setting.

🍂 As the smooth sound of the piano flows through the air, it complements the soothing surroundings, enhancing the peaceful mood. The combination of music, nature, and warmth creates a serene and reflective atmosphere, perfect for enjoying the quiet beauty of an autumn morning.

💌 Hope you all will contribute ideas to help my channel grow more and more. That's also my motivation to make the next videos better

Lyrics | كلمات

دوالي، صوت محبوبي، دوا لي
من نظرة عينها أخذت دوا لي
إجت على حيلي الفيه دوالي
تلفَّ كل عروق إيديي
قربي لجاي لمستك وشفتك
دخيل الكون عيونك وشفتك
دخيل الكون عيونك وشفتك
بيخلّي المتين يحنّي يا ياال حبّايب

أنا ورد بس ورد نرجس
كلّي برد بس صعب أرجف 
مش رمية نرد
هيدا تعبِي تعبِي هيدا تعبِي 
أنا ورد بس ورد نرجس
اسمي كافي خلّيني عَجرف
مش رمية نرد
هيدا تعبِ تعبِ هيدا تعبِ 
انا ل ارسم وجهك على القلب
ما حدّ يلمسك لا و حق الرب
لو تطلب قلب  لفرش درب
ما يغلى عليكي كل هالدنيا
لو حرقت قلبي بالنهار
بقيو عيوني بنار
حرموا جفوني النوم
اعتدت السهر يا  قليبي نام 
عودي برضى قلبي فداها يا ما نداك يصرخ أذى
برسم خطاها عودي بِهدا عودي برضى قلبي فدا

أنا ورد بس ورد نرجس
كلّي برد بس صعب أرجف 
مش رمية نرد
 هيدا تعبِي تعبِي هيدا تعبِي 
أنا ورد بس ورد نرجس
اسمي كافي خلّيني عَجرف
مش رمية نرد
هيدا هيدا تعبِ تعبِ هيدا تعبِ 

دوالي، صوت محبوبي، دوا لي
من نظرة عينها أخذت دوا لي
إجت على حيلي الفيه دوالي
تلفَّ كل عروق إيديي
برسم خطاك
عودي بهدى
عودي برضى

Lirik Proliman Joyo :

Oh-whoa-oh
Ho-oh-oh

Gemerlape lintang wengi iki sing tak sawang
Ngelingke aku marang sliramu
Bebarengan nyawiji, ono ning kutho iki
Jogo roso, ngukir tresno ning ati

Ora bakal lali, tungo iki kanggo sliramu
Mugo iso dadi pengarepanku
Ananging saiki, bedo sing tak lakoni
Kowe lungo, ninggal loro, kabeh wis mbok blenjani

Proliman Joyo ninggalke cerito loro
Sampek ati sliramu ninggalke aku
Aku ning kene nguatke ati
Ngempet eluh tangis sing ra iso tak apusi

Cukup ku berkorban
cukup aku bertahan
Gede egomu sing ngambyarke
kabeh impian

Hu-uh-uh, ha-ah-ah
Hu-ah-ah

Ora bakal lali, tungo iki kanggo sliramu
Mugo iso dadi pengarepanku
Ananging saiki, bedo sing tak lakoni
Kowe lungo, ninggal loro, kabeh wis mbok blenjani

Proliman Joyo ninggalke cerito loro
Sampek ati sliramu ninggalke aku
Aku ning kene nguatke ati
Ngempet eluh tangis sing ra iso tak apusi

Proliman Joyo ninggalke cerito loro
Sampek ati sliramu ninggalke aku
Aku ning kene nguatke ati
Ngempet eluh tangis sing ra iso tak apusi

Cukup ku berkorban
cukup aku bertahan
Gede egomu sing ngambyarke
kabeh impian

Lyrics:
Never been easy to please
Always been best on my own
I don't need her to be kind
I get my kicks all alone
I don't do walks on the beach
I don't get dress up for a shows
She got me good
I feel like a boy in love
My hearts been bruised like a peach
My souls been set like a stone
But now when Sam Cooke sings
She's got me whistling along
I didn't think I could care
But now I wait by the phone
She got me good
I feel like a boy in love
Mercy please
Suddenly I'm crawling to her on my knees
(Oh) Mercy please
Suddenly I need her like a harmony
Because she talks and she walks like a woman
She makes me feel like a boy when I shouldn’t
Oh she got me good
I feel like a boy in love
Well now I'm eager to please
When my lady is home
I’ll give her XYZ
So I can call her my own
I used to act like a man
But what did I ever know
She got me good
I feel like a boy in love
Mercy please
Suddenly I'm crawling to her on my knees
(Oh) Mercy please
Suddenly I need her like a harmony
She is the subject of all my desire
Until I found her I was merely a liar
Oh she got me good
I feel like a boy in love
Oh she got me good
I feel like a boy in love

DJ, run it back, play my song in this bitch
Vibin' like I'm alone in this bitch, mm
Tit for tat, I got your back, was I wrong for that shit?
Tell me, is we too grown for that shit? Uh
I wanna lock it in, baby, no weighin' my options
Wanna travel, see the world, gettin' drunk on an island
Wanna settle, start a family, so tell me about it
And you so perfect, baby, don't give nobody that body (Okay)
Social anxiety, I fear
And I done been this way for some years
I don't really get along with my peers
Everything that they do to me is weird
So in a world full of weirdos, fools, and scrubs
Tell me, what is it you're willin' to do for love?
You know it's true that the datin' pool is fucked
Ain't nobody out here, baby, it just be us
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know a broken heart when I see one
And I feel, and I feel, and I feel, and I feel like I love you more
Did you know? Do you know? Did you know? Do you know I'm a shoulder if you need one?
When I feel what I feel, keep it real, what’s the deal? I'm ready for
Oh, somewhere we could be alone, you and me alone
I remember bein' twenty-one when my life had just begun
Twenty-two, many things to see and do
Twenty-three, lookin' forward to twenty-four
Is it just me or it ain't no love no more?
Twenty-five, what a time to be alive
Am I getting old? Why do I feel tired?
All the same old things, the same old games
Same old pain, think it's time for a change 'cause
Certain shit ain't like me no more
Certain shit don't excite me no more
It don't excite no more, no
It ain't like me no more
No more, no more
No, no, no, no, no
Certain shit don't excite me no more
Shit ain't like me no more

(Lyrics):
[Verse 1]
Two Augusts ago
I told the truth, oh, but you didn't like it, you went home
You're in your Benz, I'm by the gate
Now you go alone
Charm all the people you train for, you mean well but aim low
And I'll make it known like I'm getting paid

[Chorus]
That's just the way life goes
I like to slam doors closed
Trust me, I know it's always about me
I love you, I'm sorry

[Verse 2]
Two summers from now
We'll have been talking, but not all that often, we're cool now
I'll be on a boat, you're on a plane going somewhere, same
And I'll have a drink
Wistfully lean out my window and watch the sun set on the lake
I might not feel real, but it's okay, mm

[Chorus]
'Cause that's just the way life goes
I push my luck, it shows
Thankful you don't send someone to kill me
I love you, I'm sorry

[Bridge]
You were the best but you were the worst
As sick as it sounds, I loved you first
I was a dick, it is what it is
A habit to kick, the age-old curse
I tend to laugh whenever I'm sad
I stare at the crash, it actually works
Making amends, this shit never ends
I'm wrong again, wrong again

[Chorus]
The way life goes
Joyriding down our road
Lay on the horn to prove that it haunts me
(I'm wrong again, wrong again)
I love you, I'm sorry
The way life goes
(You were the best but you were the worst)
(As sick as it sounds, I loved you first)
I wanna speak in code
(I was a dick, it is what it is)
(A habit to kick, the age-old curse)
Hope that I don't, won't make it about me
(I tend to laugh whenever I'm sad)
(I stare at the crash, it actually works)
I love you, I'm sorry

🌻 Good morning friends, how is your day going?
📺 Are you looking for relaxation, positivity and energy for the new day? This will be the perfect place for you!

📌 The video opens with a cozy coffee shop ambience in the heart of winter, exuding warmth amidst the cold season. At the center of the space is a wooden table and chairs placed on the floor, bathed in the soft glow of warm lights. Beside the seating area, a crackling fireplace radiates gentle heat, adding a sense of comfort and intimacy to the ambience. Opposite the table is a small bar counter adorned with neatly arranged stools. Behind the counter, the soft hum of a coffee machine fills the air, accompanied by the clinking of ceramic coffee mugs and the sight of a delicate flower vase, lending a fresh and inviting charm to the interior.

⛄ Beyond the indoor space, a wooden fence frames a serene view of a snowy lakeside landscape. Snowflakes gently fall, blanketing the ground and the wooden houses scattered across the far side of the lake. The soothing sound of Jazz Piano fills the air, perfectly blending with the tranquil and warm atmosphere of this winter retreat.

💌 Hope you all will contribute ideas to help my channel grow more and more. That's also my motivation to make the next videos better

Dafina Zeqiri & Mossi - Prit Lyrics:

Chorus:
Munesh me mprit

Pull me ferrari baby nuk o mercedez
Ai ma bon mu 
prit prit prit prit prit
Sun e nali jo
Prit prit prit prit prit

Dafina vers: 

Kur ka paranoja 
Nuk e lshoj ni zo yaya
per mu gjune gzhoja
Une si boj loja

Ski me ra, ski-ski me ra
Nese bjen aj, bi me to
Pa merak, un-jom-ajo rri  permas

Rri me to, rri - rri me to
Aj per mu osht primero
Pa merak, smunen me na ndal ata

Ti je mine yoyo
Sene tmija nuk i lo jojojoo
Jo s’tlo vet me prite
Ti e di e di
Qe un vi…

Chorus:
Munesh me mprit
Une 
Nuk
Pres
Pull me ferrari baby nuk o mercedez
Ai ma bon mu 
prit prit prit prit prit
Sun e nali jo
Prit prit prit prit prit

I pelqen shum nata, se kur del bon drit  
Duhet mi ble dhurata qe mos mu merzit
Nuk e di sa kom koh, edhe sa ki me mprit
Ka qef me ardh me mu kur dal sene me shit 

Jom tu i arrit qato qe ti kom premtu
Ty du me t bo tatu ,po nuk po kom ven ku
Me tmujt me tpa edhe kur vin mem arrestu
Edhe nese provoj mos me mujt me t'harru

Tu rreziku me ti bo qa giith ki endrru 
S'je ndiku prej fjalve qe tkan thon per mu
Ma din jeten ,tverteten n'qka kom kalu 
E kom gati bereten, tjetri me tu afru

M'ki mungu gjdo moment
Kur nuk jom kon i lir 
Shum mendime n'errsir 
I lidht me zingjir
M'ki nejt permas edhe n'diten ma tshtir
Veq me t'pa mir per kta nuk kom meshir

Nuk e di cilen deshire 
T'paren me ta kry
Kur m'thu ski me ra kurr edhe mkqyr nsy 
Nuk ka naj ligj qe un nuk muj me thy
Tregom kush tka zhgenjy 
Un e heki per ty",Dafina Zeqiri,"dafina zeqiri,DAFINA ZEQIRI,dafina,zeqiri,Dafina Zeqiri,Mossi,MOSSI,mossi,dafina mossi,prishtina,kosova,albania,duffye,Prit,prit,dafina zeqiri prit,dafina zeqiri mossi prit,mossi prit,hitet 2024,Hitet e Reja 2024",10,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music",2024-12-12T17:00:06Z,PT3M23S,7489367,2801,False,,

Lyrics:
I was in a sheer dress
The day that we met 
We were both in a rush 
We talked for a sec 
Your friend hit me up 
So we could connect
And what are the odds 
You send me a text 
And now the next 
Thing I know I’m like 
Manifest
That you’re oversized 
I digress 
Got me scrollin’ like 
Out of breath 
Got me going like 
Oooo ahhhhh 
 
Who’s the cute boy with the white jacket and the thick accent like 
(Ahhhhh) 
Maybe it’s all in my head 
 
But I bet we’d have really good bed chem 
How you pick me up pull ‘em down turn me round oh it just makes sense 
How you talk so sweet when you’re doing bad things 
That’s bed chem 
How you’re looking at me yea I know what that means and 
I’m obsessed
Are you free next week? 
I’d bet we’d have really good 
 
Come right on me 
I mean camaraderie    
Said you’re not in my time zone but you wanna be 
Where art thou? Why not uponeth me? 
See it my mind let’s fulfill the prophecy 
 
Who’s the cute guy with wide blue eyes and the big bad mmm like 
I know I sound a bit redundant 
 
But I bet we’d have really good bed chem 
How you pick me up pull ‘em down turn me round oh it just makes sense 
How you talk so sweet when you’re doing bad things 
That’s bed chem 
How you’re looking at me yeah I know what that means and 
I’m obsessed
Are you free next week? 
I’d bet we’d have really good 
Bed chem 
 
And I bet we’d both arrive at the same time 
And I bet the thermostats set at six nine 
And I bet it’s even better than in my head 


How you pick me up pull ‘em down turn me round oh it just makes sense 
How you talk so sweet when you’re doing bad things 
That’s bed chem 
How you’re looking at me yeah I know what that means and 
I’m obsessed
Are you free next week? 
I’d bet we’d have really good

(20% Christmas Sale for Whole Shop, Too!!)


You've just found a lost production tape to the 2D animated pilot for Amanda The Adventurer! Pop it in and watch Amanda and Wooly play Hide and Seek again! And Again! And Again! And-- Wait... Seems Amanda would rather play something else... Wouldn't you like to Play Her Way?


It’s finally here!! The full music video for our song “Play My Way”! Not only that, it’s an official music video this time!! Ain’t that fun??
Originally when we started working on this, this was going to be a simple lyric video for the sake of time. We struggle to half do anything though, and this is now one of our most ambitious projects! Jax Toy will most likely be even more ambitious visually, but this music video is definitely an accumulation of the skills we’ve learned from our last projects INCLUDING Jax Toy!

All the Team Neutron members that got to work on this were firing on all cylinders! Adding their own flavor to any tasks they chose or were given, with a few new breakout artists that had this be their FIRST team neutron project!

I kind of crunched myself a lot with this video, during a time where money was extremely tight, but I’m sure the quality jump from Don’t Listen will be worth it. So I hope you all enjoy!

Lyrics:
[Intro]
Oh, Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make him mine, mine
Oh Santa
Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make him mine, mine
Oh Santa
 
[Verse 1]
Santa
If you get this letter
Won't you help me out?
I know you're kinda busy with your elves right now
And I don't know how
You do the things you do while I sleep on Christmas eve
But it's amazing
And I bet that you could bring me back my baby
Because every time I see Christmas lights
I feel this burn inside
And I just can't take it
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
I saw them shopping last week
And his new girl was so bleak
And then I swore to myself
Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas night
 
[Chorus]
Ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas night
 
[Verse 2]
Oh Santa
I heard that it's really gonna snow this year
So I hope Rudolph and them other eight reindeer
Get you safely here
So you can scoop him up and swoop him right down my chimney
I've been really, really, really good this year
So put on that red suit and make him appear
’Cause Christmas cheer
Just ain't the same without my baby
Come on, oh Kris Kringle, send me help
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
They say it's unrealistic
But I believe in you Saint Nick
So grant this wish for me right quick
Santa won't you come and make him mine this Christmas night?
 
[Chorus]
Ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gonna come and make you mine this Christmas night
 
[Post-Chorus]
Oh, Santa
Oh, Santa
Oh, Santa
Come on, Santa
 
[Refrain]
Oh Santa
Santa gon' come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa gon' come and make him mine, mine
Oh Santa
Santa gon' come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa gon' come and make him mine, mine
 
[Verse 3]
Oh, Santa Claus
If you get this letter, please don't make me wait
'Cause all December I'll be counting down the days
So hop on your sleigh
I promise that I won't forget the milk and cookies
 
[Pre-Chorus 3]
The trees all sparkly and gold
But inside I feel so cold
So soon as you leave the North Pole
Santa won't you come and make him mine this Christmas?
 
[Chorus]
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho

Lyrics:

Somethings got a hold of me lately 
No, I don’t know myself anymore 
Feels like the walls are all closing in 
And the devil’s knocking at my door 
Woooahhh
Out of my mind, how many times 
Did I tell you I’m no good at being alone 
Yea, it’s taking a toll on me 
Trying my best to keep from tearing the skin off my bones 
Don’t you know
I lose control 
When you’re not next to me 
I’m falling apart right in front of you 
Can’t you see 
I lose control 
When you’re not next to me, mhm 
Yea, you’re breaking my heart 
You make a mess of me 
Problematic problem is I want your body like a fiend 
like a bad habit 
Bad habits hard to break when I’m with you 
Yeah I know I could do it on my own but I want 
That real full moon black magic and it takes two 
Problematic problem is when I’m with you I’m an addict 
And I need some release 
My skin in your teeth 
Can’t see the forest through the trees 
Got down on my knees 
Darlin, please 
Oooohhhh 
I lose control 
When you’re not next to me 
I’m falling apart right in front of you 
Can’t you see 
I lose control 
When you’re not next to me, mhmmm 
Yea, you’re breaking my heart baby 
You make a mess of me, yeahhh 
I lose control 
When you’re not here with me, mhmm 
I’m falling apart right in front of you 
Can’t you see 
I lose control 
When you’re not here with me, mhm 
Yea, you’re breaking my heart baby 
You make a mess of me, yeahhh

Lyrics:
We were good, we were gold
Kinda dream that can’t be sold 
We were right til we weren’t
Built a home and watched it burn 
 
I didn’t wanna leave you 
I didn’t wanna lie
Started to cry but then remembered I
 
I can buy myself flowers 
Write my name in the sand 
Talk to myself for hours 
Say things you don’t understand 
I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah I can love me better than you can
 
I can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
 
Paint my nails, cherry red 
Match the roses that you left 
No remorse, no regret
I forgive every word you said 
 
I didn’t wanna wanna leave you 
I didn’t wanna fight 
Started to cry but then remembered I 
 
I can buy myself flowers 
Write my name in the sand 
Talk to myself for hours 
Say things you don’t understand 
I can take myself dancing 
And I can hold my own hand 
Yeah I can love me better than you can 
 
I can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I can love me better baby
Can love me better
I
 
I didn’t wanna wanna leave you 
I didn’t wanna fight 
Started to cry but then remembered I 
 
I can buy myself flowers

LYRICS:

Intro]
(Run that back, Turbo)

[Verse 1]
Scrooge McDuck, got one of my rooms all flooded with gold (Gold) 
I done bought two, four, five, six, seven, eight karats in stones (In stones)
Cash on the California castle, can't wait to go dress my home (Dress my home)
Smash all you itty-bitty rappers been a minute, I was tryna prolong (Tryna prolong)
On the way to reachin' my goals, lot of doors open and close (Open and close)
I've been spendin' millions on clothes, I been makin' millions off clothes (Millions off clothes)
Stackin' new money to old, garments they vintage and old (Vintage and old)
Cut up my shirt full of holes, GunWunna got a lot of hoes (Got a lot of hoes)
Shoutout my cousin, my cuz , my kin, my blood, my folk (My folk)
Hold my ten , I plant the seed, give it water to grow (For my team)
Half a million euros in a third-world country, I travel the coast (Travelin', yeah)
Always said that I wanted, young Wunna done done it, I do what they don't (Young Wunna, the man)

[Chorus]
They was tryna stunt my growth, I was steady chasin' my goals
Nigga, why you watchin'? I'm grown, nigga can't take my throne
Goin' through the motions, stay strong, he done been him all along (Him)
Look at all this money we done grown, lot of different places I done flown

[Verse 2]
Freaky lil' bitch, she swallow my kids (She swallow my kids)
Pull up on the kid, she left her kid, at home
It's 10 P.M. in Atlanta, where I'm at, it's four in the morn'
Marbella Spain ', and the view is the insane round the corner from Jordan (Jordan)
Speed in the coupe, Jeff Gordon, I got the foreign imported (Foreign imported)
Knew that we sold out the Barclay', now we gon' sell out the Garden (Gon' sell out the Garden)
Drop, I'ma fuck up the market, young Gunna really a martian (I'm really a martian)
Excusin' me through like a pardon, and I'm protected by carbons

[Chorus]
They was tryna stunt my growth, I was steady chasin' my goals
Nigga, why you watchin'? I'm grown, nigga can't take my throne
Goin' through the motions, stay strong, he done been him all along (Him)
Look at all this money we done grown, lot of different places I done flown

[Outro]
On the way to
 finish my goals, lot of doors open and close

Lyrics:
Terdiam di tatapanmu
Menghantui pikiranku,
terus menerus
Tak lupa hangat senyummu
Hiasi gelap malamku

Kau datang tak ku duga
Beri aku tawa
Bahagia hariku,
kau buat sempurna
Mungkin kita bisa berjalan bersama
Tunggu sejenak ini belum saat nya

Serasa kuingin katakan pada dunia
Seberapa ku inginkanmu,
temani hidupku yang dulu kelam
Kau jadikan penuh makna
Tunggu sejenak ini belum saat nya

Banyak harapku untukmu
Di dalam tidurku dan bangunku

Kau datang tak ku duga
Beri aku tawa
Bahagia hariku,
kau buat sempurna
Mungkin kita bisa berjalan bersama
Tunggu sejenak ini belum saat nya

Serasa kuingin katakan pada dunia
Seberapa ku inginkanmu,
temani hidupku yang dulu kelam
Kau jadikan penuh makna
Tunggu sejenak ini belum saat nya

Kan tiba waktunya
Tuk ungkapkan semua (kepadamu)

Serasa kuingin katakan pada dunia
Seberapa ku inginkanmu,
temani hidupku yang dulu kelam
Kau jadikan penuh makna
Tunggu sejenak ini belum saat nya

Tunggu apa lagi
Ini lah saat nya

LYRICS:

Intro]
(Run that back, Turbo)

[Verse 1]
Scrooge McDuck, got one of my rooms all flooded with gold (Gold) 
I done bought two, four, five, six, seven, eight karats in stones (In stones)
Cash on the California castle, can't wait to go dress my home (Dress my home)
Smash all you itty-bitty rappers been a minute, I was tryna prolong (Tryna prolong)
On the way to reachin' my goals, lot of doors open and close (Open and close)
I've been spendin' millions on clothes, I been makin' millions off clothes (Millions off clothes)
Stackin' new money to old, garments they vintage and old (Vintage and old)
Cut up my shirt full of holes, GunWunna got a lot of hoes (Got a lot of hoes)
Shoutout my cousin, my cuz , my kin, my blood, my folk (My folk)
Hold my ten , I plant the seed, give it water to grow (For my team)
Half a million euros in a third-world country, I travel the coast (Travelin', yeah)
Always said that I wanted, young Wunna done done it, I do what they don't (Young Wunna, the man)

[Chorus]
They was tryna stunt my growth, I was steady chasin' my goals
Nigga, why you watchin'? I'm grown, nigga can't take my throne
Goin' through the motions, stay strong, he done been him all along (Him)
Look at all this money we done grown, lot of different places I done flown

[Verse 2]
Freaky lil' bitch, she swallow my kids (She swallow my kids)
Pull up on the kid, she left her kid, at home
It's 10 P.M. in Atlanta, where I'm at, it's four in the morn'
Marbella Spain ', and the view is the insane round the corner from Jordan (Jordan)
Speed in the coupe, Jeff Gordon, I got the foreign imported (Foreign imported)
Knew that we sold out the Barclay', now we gon' sell out the Garden (Gon' sell out the Garden)
Drop, I'ma fuck up the market, young Gunna really a martian (I'm really a martian)
Excusin' me through like a pardon, and I'm protected by carbons

[Chorus]
They was tryna stunt my growth, I was steady chasin' my goals
Nigga, why you watchin'? I'm grown, nigga can't take my throne
Goin' through the motions, stay strong, he done been him all along (Him)
Look at all this money we done grown, lot of different places I done flown

[Outro]
On the way to
 finish my goals, lot of doors open and close

🎤 Lyrics: Laufey - Santa Baby 

[Intro]
(Santa baby, ah!)
(Hurry up be mine!)

[Verse 1]
Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree
For me
Been an awful good girl
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 2]
Santa baby, a '54 convertible, too
Light blue
I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 3]
Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year I'll be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list

[Verse 4]
Santa baby, I want a yacht
And really that's not a lot
Been an angel all year
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight
(Hurry up be mine!)
(Santa baby, ah!)

[Verse 5]
Santa honey, one little thing I really need
The deed to a platinum mine
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 6]
Santa cutie, and fill my stocking with the duplеx
And checks
Sign your 'x' on the line
Santa cutiе, and hurry down the chimney tonight

[Verse 7]
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

[Verse 8]
Santa baby, forgot to one mention one little thing
A ring
I don't mean on the phone
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight

[Outro]
(Santa baby, ah!)
(Hurry up be mine!)
(Santa baby, ah!)

Lagu ini merupakan curahan hati Leika yang merasakan hangatnya persahabatan. Leika berharap, persahabatan ini akan menjadi sebuah perjalanan yang terus ada hingga mereka dewasa. Lirik dan nada dasar lagu ini diciptakan oleh Leika dengan beberapa bantuan dari sang Ayah (Ilman Hidayat), Bunda (Diena Fitri), Om Saka, dan Om Wisnu dalam pengolahannya. Leika berharap lagu ini tidak hanya menjadi pengingat #sahabat untuk teman seusianya saja, namun juga orang dewasa yang merindukan kehadiran #sahabat.

ENGLISH LYRICS: 
All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh oh
Sing it worldwide

No one could hear me, I was singing secretly to myself
But now I step forward without fear, I feel
Better, confident, I’m feeling good about myself
I felt lost but the music got me

Screaming from the rooftop
Come on, shout it out
Everybody sing it out loud

All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh oh
Sing it worldwide
In harmony, together we unite
Oh oh oh
Together until the end
We’ll go beyond the stars, our light shining forever
Screaming from the rooftop, shout it out
All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh oh
Till the end of time

But what if it gets silent
A world without sound
No one listens to each other's stories anymore
So don’t turn down the lights, come sing along

Let's sing in harmony
And join us in the symphony
Everyone understands the language of music

All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh oh
Sing it worldwide
In harmony
Together we unite
Oh oh oh
Together until the end

We’ll go beyond the stars, our light shining forever
Screaming from the rooftop, SHOUT IT OUT
All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh oh
Till the end of time

The music got me like
Oh oh sing
Oh oh
Like oh oh sing
Oh oh sing
Oh oh
Like oh oh sing
Oh oh sing
All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh oh
Sing it worldwide

Born With a Broken Heart
 
I’ve been tryin’ to change (oooh)
Tryin to find somebody to love me 
Oh Love but I end up in the same damn place again
Hopin I could be different
But I’d be playin’ pretend
 
I wish that I was perfect (just like you)
But I’m an alien
Oh love I’m sending out an sos, take me home
We’re not meant to be together, no
 
What if I said I’m trying
To save your love from dying
Baby I’m too far gone
Don’t wanna see you crying
But I just  know who I am
Maybe that’s the hardest part ohhh
Baby you can’t fix me
I was born with a broken heart 
  
If I was a cactus (ohhh)
You would be a balloon
Oh love
I wanna feel the same as humans do
I wanna feel the same as you, but I don’t
 
What if I said I’m trying
To save your love from dying
Baby I’m too far gone
Don’t wanna see you crying

But I just know who I am
Maybe that’s the hardest part ohhh
Baby you can’t fix me
I was born with a broken heart 
 
 
Ahhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhh
I’m sorry 
That I’m leaving 
Ahhhhhhh
Ahhhhhhh
I’m sorry 
We’re just different
But baby you can’t fix me
 
What if I said I’m trying
To save your love from dying
Baby I’m too far gone
Don’t wanna see you crying
But I just know who I am
Maybe that’s the hardest part ohhh
Baby you can’t fix me
Baby you can’t fix me
Baby you can’t fix me
I was born with a broken heart

► LYRICS:

Ich seh‘ dich vor mir, Fata Morgana 
Ich schau‘ in die Augen, die nie für mich da war‘n 
Ein bisschen zu kalt und zu schön für die Wahrheit  
Du bist eine Lüge, man hat mich gewarnt  
 
Ich warte auf ‘ne Stimme  
Ich warte auf ‘ne Antwort  
Ich kann dich nicht mehr finden 
Unbekannter Standort 
 
Ich tappe hier im Dunkeln 
Kommt mir irgendwie bekannt vor 
Manchmal reicht ein kleiner Funke 
Deiner hinterlässt ein Brandloch 
 
Da ist noch Licht in deiner Wohnung, ich lauf‘ zufällig dran vorbei 
Für die perfekte Illusion raubst du mir gerne meine Zeit 
Auch wenn ich weiß, dass wir nicht echt sind 
Auch wenn ich weiß, dass wir nicht echt sind 
Schlaf‘ ich heut‘ neben dir ein 
 
Und ich seh‘ dich vor mir, Fata Morgana 
Ich schau‘ in die Augen, die nie für mich da war‘n 
Ein bisschen zu kalt und zu schön für die Wahrheit  
Du bist eine Lüge, man hat mich gewarnt 
 
Und ich seh‘ dich vor mir, Fata Morgana 
Ich schau‘ in die Augen, die nie für mich da war‘n 
Ein bisschen zu kalt und zu schön für die Wahrheit  
Du bist eine Lüge, man hat mich gewarnt 
 
Da sind hundert rote Flaggen und du tanzt mit ihnen im Wind 
Ich schau‘ dich so gerne an bis um dich rum alles verschwimmt 
Und du gehst wieder so weit, bis du nicht weißt, was wir noch sind 
Solange tanz‘ ich mit, bis da wirklich nichts mehr ist 
 
Da ist noch Licht in deiner Wohnung, ich lauf‘ einfach dran vorbei 
Die perfekte Illusion hat für mich einfach nicht gereicht 
Ich lieg‘ endlich nicht mehr neben dir, doch schlaf‘ auch nicht mehr ein 
Hab‘ Angst von dir zu träumen 
 
Und ich seh‘ dich vor mir, Fata Morgana 
Ich schau‘ in die Augen, die nie für mich da war‘n 
Ein bisschen zu kalt und zu schön für die Wahrheit  
Du bist eine Lüge, man hat mich gewarnt 

Und ich seh‘ dich vor mir, Fata Morgana 
Ich schau‘ in die Augen, die nie für mich da war‘n 
Ein bisschen zu kalt und zu schön für die Wahrheit  
Du bist eine Lüge, man hat mich gewarnt 

Man hat mich gewarnt
Du bist eine Lüge
Man hat mich gewarnt 
Du bist eine Lüge
Du bist eine Lüge
Du bist eine

ENGLISH LYRICS: 
All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh oh
Sing it worldwide

No one could hear me, I was singing secretly to myself
But now I step forward without fear, I feel
Better, confident, I’m feeling good about myself
I felt lost but the music got me

Screaming from the rooftop
Come on, shout it out
Everybody sing it out loud

All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh oh
Sing it worldwide
In harmony, together we unite
Oh oh oh
Together until the end
We’ll go beyond the stars, our light shining forever
Screaming from the rooftop, shout it out
All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh oh
Till the end of time

But what if it gets silent
A world without sound
No one listens to each other's stories anymore
So don’t turn down the lights, come sing along

Let's sing in harmony
And join us in the symphony
Everyone understands the language of music

All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh oh
Sing it worldwide
In harmony
Together we unite
Oh oh oh
Together until the end

We’ll go beyond the stars, our light shining forever
Screaming from the rooftop, SHOUT IT OUT
All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh oh
Till the end of time

The music got me like
Oh oh sing
Oh oh
Like oh oh sing
Oh oh sing
Oh oh
Like oh oh sing
Oh oh sing
All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh oh
Sing it worldwide

About Kes:
Of the many musical acts which call Trinidad & Tobago home, perhaps none embody its polyglot culture more than KES, the eclectic soca outfit behind some of modern Caribbean music’s most indelible anthems. Celebrated for Carnival hits (“Wotless,” “Savannah Grass”) and island pop jams (“Tuesday on the Rocks,” “Endless Summer”), the band has brought Trinidad to the world, sharing stages with the likes of Will Smith, Major Lazer and John Legend. For the group — charismatic singer Kees Dieffenthaler (aka KES) and his brothers Jon (guitar) and Hans (drums), along with childhood friend, Riad Boochoon (bass) —blending soca, pop, rock, reggae, calypso, dancehall and afrobeats together is one part of their greater calling: To spread good vibes. The last three years have proven to be the most successful in the band’s decade-plus-run. “Hello,” a fusion of afrobeats and soca originally released in 2017, continues to reach new audiences over two years after its release. With over 40 million plays on YouTube alone, it is one of the most streamed soca songs of all time. We Home, a live project recorded during the Covid-19 quarantine, is the band’s first album in over five years, with fresh renditions of KES’ carnival classics showcasing their prowess as a live band par excellence.

Zuchu's latest track, ""Antenna,"" is a high-energy dance anthem that fuses Bongo Flava with Amapiano beats. In this electrifying song, Zuchu urges everyone to wave their bandanas like antennas, having danced and vibed so hard that they’ve sweated from head to toe. With its infectious groove and a shoutout to her producer Pablo for his masterful beat-making, ""Antenna"" is a track you’ll have on repeat, keeping the energy high all night.

(Lyrics):
Your morning eyes, I could stare like watching stars
I could walk you by, and I'll tell without a thought
You'd be mine
Would you mind if i took your hand tonight
Know you're all that I want this life
I'll imagine we fell in love
I'll nap under moonlight skies with you
I think I'll picture us, you with the waves
The oceans colors on your face
I'll leave my heart with your air
So let me fly with you
Will you be forever with me

My love will always stay by you
I'll keep it safe so don't you worry a thing, I'll tell you i love you more
It's stuck with you forever so promise you won't let it go
I'll trust the universe will always bring me to you
I'll imagine we fell in love
I'll nap under moonlight skies with you
I think I'll picture us, you with the waves
The oceans colors on your face
I'll leave my heart with your air
So let me fly with you
Will you be forever with me

As you wake up in a cold sweat
Little girl, what goes on in your head?
All this hatred in your heart, yet
I mourn the most for all the things that I never said

Don’t make me go through this again
You’re not real and I can’t pretend
This story is over, I ripped out the end
Tell me, who are you, then?

What have they done to us?
What have they done to us?
What have they done to us?
What have they done to us?

""Eklai Bhayeni - Mero Adhuro Prem"" portrays the emotional turmoil of characters passing through the aftermath of a breakup. It renders the emotions of love, loss, regret, and the painful process of moving on from someone you once cherished dearly. It captures the heartache and silence after a breakup, and the recurring feeling of a love left unfinished.

LYRICS

Me a date two people at the same time
Just weighing my options
Playing two sides of the same coin
Might end up inna some problems
But
A nuh cheat me a cheat just a date by law
And if me give it up me not doing it raw
If you try fi stop me from do what I want
Me and you nuh deh mi love, you can’t give me no talk
Just a be myself, mi just a play my part
If you fall in love then that a your fault
Mi know that it might sound crazy
But till me pick you, you have to share, me share me

You a nuh mi man
Me nafi explain
Mi nuh have no obligation
Journey might be slow
But me have to sure say you're the one
So me have couple a unu in a rotation
All mi needs them haffi met
Can you cut the check?
If you the best candidate
Then you get elect
And if you wah go
Baby you can go
And me wouldn’t blame you
Because me never claim you
Have two people a ring my phone line
And a ask ""when we a go spend time?""
Me a play two sides at the same
Me just a mingle baby cuz me outside

Seeing two people at the same time
Just weighing my options
Playing two sides of the same coin
Might end up inna some problems
But
A nuh cheat me a cheat just a date by law
And if me give it up me not doing it raw
If you try fi stop me from do what I want
Me and you nuh deh mi love, you can’t give me no talk
Just a be myself, mi just a play my part
If you fall in love then that a your fault
Mi know say it might sound crazy
But till me pick you, you have to share, me share me

This a just the warm-up
You either compete or give it all up
Me nuh promiscuous just nah get stuck
This ya gyal ya head smart she nuh get caught up too quick
Take me time nah rush
Nuh tek me go a court, hope seh you don’t judge
No boy alive can’t pass up
So till the day my mind made up
I’ll date...

Two people at the same time
Gotta weigh my options
Playing both sides of the same coin
Might end up inna some problems
But
A nuh cheat me a cheat just a date by law
And if me give it up me not doing it raw
If you try fi stop me from do what I want
Me and you nuh deh mi love, you can’t give me no talk
Just a be myself, mi just a play my part
If you fall in love then that a your fault
Mi know say it might sound crazy
But me pick you, you have to share, me share

Ahhh
Ahhhhhhh
Me na commit no crime

Kids Fun TV:
Kids Fun TV, also known as the Fun Squad, is a fun family friendly channel created by the Skye family. Whether it’s games or fun action skits, the kids and their parents love to have fun and play. We have lots of boys vs girls competition videos as well as twin vs twin games. We love box forts, toys and playing fun and exciting games. Whether it’s playing jokes on their dad with a toy, having an amazing birthday party, singing cover songs, creating movie remakes or having a fun superhero adventure, these funny kids love to have fun and play. Sneaky as a spy and skilled as a ninja, the Fun Squad members team up and work together to solve a mystery in each skit adventure. The children (Jack Skye, Jazzy Skye, Kade Skye, Kalia Skye and Kyler Skye) love to have lots of family fun (with Mom and Dad also) in their skits and games. 
The Kids Fun TV channel loves making fun videos for kids and fun videos for ages 13 and older.

""BAM BAM"" Versuri:

Ai crezut ca m-ai ranit
Dar tot tu ai suferit
Bam bam bam, Bam bam bam

Complicat
Tu sau eu, cine-i vinovat?
Cum de-am ajuns asa?
In bucati sa-mi rupi inima

Vant si ploi
Baby nu mai vreau inapoi
Nu mai am cer senin
Doar lacrimi si venin

Pareai sincer cand minteai
Vorbe dulci cand ma iubeai
Baby boy I say bye bye

Ai crezut ca m-ai ranit
Dar tot tu ai suferit
Bam bam bam, Bam bam bam

Voi fi bine-n lipsa ta
Nu mai sunt eu victima
Bam bam bam, Bam bam bam

E tarziu si luna arde
Arde si telefonu’ aici pe podea
Amintiri ce le port
Cu mine peste tot
De ce te mai tin in brate
Cand nu mai vreau sa am sperante, nu vreau
Nici cu tine nu pot
Dar fara tine pierd tot
Stii ca
N-am vreo vina
Io, nu
Ca tu esti soare si furtuna
Doua-n una

Ai crezut ca m-ai ranit
Dar tot tu ai suferit
Bam bam bam, Bam bam bam
Voi fi bine-n lipsa ta
Nu mai sunt eu victima
Bam bam bam, Bam bam bam

Vrei sa ma ai
N-ai cum
Ti-am dat iubire oricum
Oricum ai vrut
N-ai cum
Nu nu
N-ai cum n-ai cum

Ai crezut ca m-ai ranit
Dar tot tu ai suferit
Bam bam bam, Bam bam bam
Voi fi bine-n lipsa ta
Nu mai sunt eu victima
Bam bam bam, Bam bam bam

🎤 Lyrics: Craig David - Insomnia

[Intro]
Jim Beanz, give it to me, oh baby I can't!

[Verse 1]
Never thought that I'd fall in love, love, love, love
But it grew from a simple crush, crush, crush, crush
Being without you girl, I was all messed up, up, up, up
When you walked out, said that you'd had enough-nough-nough

[Pre-Chorus]
Been a fool, girl, I know
Didn't expect this is how things would go
Maybe in time, you'll change your mind
Now looking back, I wish I could rewind

[Chorus]
Because I can't sleep 'til you're next to me
No, I can't live without you no more
Oh, I stay up 'til you're next to me
'Til this house feels like it did before

[Post-Chorus]
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah

[Verse 2]
Remember telling my boys that I'd never fall in love, love, love, love
You used to think I'd never find a girl I could trust, trust, trust, trust
And then you walked into my life and it was all about us, us, us, us
But now, I'm sitting here, thinking I messed the whole thing up, up, up, up

[Pre-Chorus]
Been a fool (fool), girl, I know (know)
Didn't expect this is how things would go
Maybe in time (time), you'll change your mind (mind)
Now looking back, I wish I could rewind

[Chorus]
Because I can't sleep 'til you're next to me
No, I can't live without you no more (without you no more)
Oh, I stay up 'til you're next to me (to me)
'Til this house feels like it did before

[Post-Chorus]
Because it feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah

[Bridge]
Ah, I just can't go to sleep
'Cause it feels like I've fallen for you
It's getting way too deep
And I know that it's love because
[Chorus]
I can't sleep 'til you're next to me
No, I can't live without you no more (without you no more)
Oh, I stay up 'til you're next to me (to me)
'Til this house feels like it did before

[Post-Chorus]
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah

Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah

 but this guy is on another level” Friends,relatives and the neighbors  they say, “What on earth is this guy doing?"" no matter how much they curse and spread rumours If they say you’re being dope, isn’t that really dope? I know why they talk like that, because everything doesn’t always go as planned. Whatever happens, have the courage to say`tha pathukalam’, Feeling sad about what’s already gone is a time waste. “Stand tall before a society that stabs you when you're down"" said poet’u Dhanush the great! but people keep spreading hate illogically. If so, am i the next Andrew Tate? Spreading hate online is the new internet culture? Honestly, prostitution would be a better hobby!  Even if a thousand people hide it with dirty hands The sun will still rise after settling down in the evening. Hey, Do you even know where this guy comes from? You talk like you know something, don’t say a word.  Oh man, he’s such a notorious guy, isn’t he? That’s no one else—it’s me, I'm that guy! Who’s that guy?  I’m that guy! Who’s that guy?  I’m that guy! Who’s that guy?  I’m that guy! Who’s that guy?  I’m that guy! Is this all lyrics? was these written by Asal Kolaar? he is not Asal Kolaar,  he is complete Kolaar! “Y’all will see one day” At five, they gave me beatings  and made me realize that crying is a waste which is how I became strong..  Uncomfortable situations will shape your maturity - and wisdom, am i right ? Even from stealing, you learn tricks and strategies, but there’s so much more to experience in life. Few backstab you to get bigger,  few get stomach burn from those who are already bigger. Should i bring a fire engine?! don’t hide and see  Like a fake ID ""Sivaranjini underscore 15"". to those who give illegal entry and cause problems, Ill attack and chase them out  like Donald Trump! `Asal Kolaar - Chikkom  Yelra Teasta’ If I get bored, I’ll go around in my dad’s boat along the coast.  Even if I go to Kuala Lumpur,  I’ll still speak thandaiyarpetta slang.  I’ll eat local food there, like dosa, and also some h*es. You file a CBI complaint?  I’ll drain your UPI account. If you comment in URL, ill break your face in IRL. Hey, Do you even know where this guy comes from? You talk like you know something, don’t say a word.  Oh man, he’s such a notorious guy, isn’t he?

🌻 Good morning friends, how is your day going?
📺 Are you looking for relaxation, positivity and energy for the new day? This will be the perfect place for you!

📌 The video begins with a warm and inviting Christmas coffee shop, where the festive spirit fills the air. At the center of the space, a red sofa set is perfectly arranged to provide a cozy spot for visitors. Beside it, a large crackling fireplace gently, radiating warmth and casting a soft glow across the room. Nearby, a beautifully decorated Christmas tree stands tall, adorned with shimmering LED lights, colorful ornaments, and a glowing star on top. Adjacent to the tree is a charming coffee bar with a few wooden stools. The bar is equipped with a modern coffee machine, neatly arranged coffee cups, and softly flickering candles. Above the bar, a string of warm LED lights hangs, adding a magical touch to the ambience.

🎄 Through the wooden fence of the coffee shop, the view opens to a serene winter night. A tranquil lake reflects the snowy landscape, as delicate snowflakes fall gently from the sky. Across the lake, a few cozy wooden cabins glow softly, their lights creating a picturesque scene. As smooth jazz melodies fill the cafe, the combination of music, warmth, and the enchanting winter setting creates a perfect holiday atmosphere.

💌 Hope you all will contribute ideas to help my channel grow more and more. That's also my motivation to make the next videos better
💕 Here are some specific ways that this music can be used:

Ci vediamo in Tour nel 2025 🎟️ https://www.ticketone.it/artist/me-contro-te/

TESTO:
Scusate per l’attesa
Non volevamo drammi
Aspetti sto momento fra da tipo 7 anni

Ma che c’hai ti vedo pallido 
Con due video ho fatto il panico 
Noi con il disco di platino 
Voi con il vizio dei plagi bro 

Da quanto ci copi la roba virale
 Dovresti pagare la percentuaaaale
Abbiamo fatto anche il film di Natale
Voi al massimo vi fate un film ma mentale

We bro we bro 
Benvenuto, welcome
Forse mi hai visto su webboh
Cos’è che fai te sul web? boh

Dai tempi d’oro di YouTube italia da quando c’era favij 
Se vuoi fare il drama ama vi facciamo sciogliere un po’ come i Mates 

E Fate cose un po’ diverse
Non che rifate le stesse
Quale Fedez contro Tony effe 
Voglion tutti noi col signor S

Smascherarvi era una missione
Voglio Dario Moccia come autore 
Ma chi volete superare?
Forse sto dissing vi ha fatto male

Dici non lo faccio apposta
questa è violazione del copyright
Se vuoi abbiamo fatto anche il podcast
ecco un’altra cosa che copierai

Siete solo una copia copia copia copia

Lyrics of Chikni Chameli - चिकनी चमेली
bicchu mere naina, badi zeherili ankkh maare
kamsin kamriya saali ik thumke se lakh maare
haye bicchu mere naina, badi zeherili ankkh maare
kamsin kamriya saali ik thumke se lakh maare
note hazaaro ke khulla chhutta karaane aayi
husn ki teeli se beedi chillam jalaane aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhupke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhupke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhupke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhupke akeli pavva chadhake aayi

jungle me aaj mangal karungi bhukhe shero se khelugi main
makkhan jaisi hatheli pe jalte angaare le lungi main
haye gehre paani ki machhli hu raja
ghsat ghsat dariya me ghumi hu main
teri nazron ki lehero se haar ke aaj dubi hu mai
hoye jaanleva jalwa hai, dekhne me halwa hai
jaanleva jalwa hai, hai dekhne me halwa hai
pyaar se paros doongi toot le zara
ye to trailer hai, puri film dikhaane aayi
husn ki teeli se bidi chillam jalaane aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhup ke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhup ke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhup ke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhup ke akeli pavva chadhake aayi

banjar basti me aayi hai masti aisa namkin chehra tera
meri niyat pe chad gaya chhute na hai rang gehra tera
joban ye mera khenchi hai raja saare pardo ko katungi main
shaame meri akeli hai aaja sang tere baatungi main
haye baato me ishaara hai, jisme khel saara hai
baato me ishara hai jisme khel saara hai
tod ke tijoriyo ko loot le zara
choom ke zakhmo pe thoda malham lagaane aayi
husn ki teeli se beedi chillam jalaane aayi
aayi chikni aayi, aayi chikni aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhup ke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhup ke akeli pavva chadhake aayi

১)আকাশের চাঁদ মাটির বুকেতে জোৎস্না
২)মন বলছে কেউ আসবে কিছু বলবে 
৩)তুমি আছো এত কাছে তাই পৃথিবীতে 
৪)কথা দিলাম আমি কথা দিলাম তুমি 
৫)ফল কেন লাল হয় সেকি জানা যায় 
৬)যাদু যাদু কে বলে দেখবে যাদু 
৭)প্রাণ আজ গান গেয়ে শুধু বলে যায় 
৮)চিরদিনই তুমি যে আমার যুগে যুগে 
৯)আমি যার ওই নীল। চোখে ভেসে থাকি 
১০)কোথায় রাখবো প্রেম বলো না আমার

Song Lyrics:

Barsaat Ke Mausam Mein
Tanhaai Ke Aalam Main
Barsaat Ke Mausam Mein
Tanhai Ke Aalam Main
Main Ghar Se Nikal Aaya
Botal Bhi Utha Laaya
Abhi Zinda Hoon Toh Jee Lene Do
Jee Lene Do
Bhari Barsaat Mein Pee Lene Do
Abhi Zinda Hoon Toh Jee Lene Do
Jee Lene Do
Bhari Barsaat Mein Pee Lene Do
Barsaat Ke Mausam Mein
Hmmm...

Jee Lene Do
Bhari Barsaat Mein Pee Lene Do
Abhi Zinda Hoon Toh Jee Lene Do
Jee Lene Do
Bhari Barsaat Mein Pee Lene Do
Mujhe Tukado Mein Nahi Jeena Hai
Katra Katra Toh Nahi Peena Hai
Ho ...
Mujhe Tukado Mein Nahi Jeena Hai
Katra Katra Toh Nahi Peena Hai
Ho ...
Aaj Paimaaney Hata Do Yaaron
Saara Maikhana Peela Do Yaaro
Maikadon Main Toh Piya Karta Hoon
Maikadon Main To Piya Karta Hoon
Chalti Raahon Mein Bhi Pee Lene Do

Abhi Zinda Hoon Toh Jee Lene Do
Jee Lene Do
Bhari Barsaat Mein Pee Lene Do
Mere Dushman Hai Zamaane Ke Gham
Baad Peene Ke Yeh Honge Kam
Ho...
Mere Dushman Hai Zamaane Ke Gham
Baad Peene Ke Yeh Honge Kam
Ho ...
Zulm Duniya Ke Na Sehe Paoonga
Bin Piye Aaj Na Rehe Paaonga
Mujhe Haalat Se Takraana Hai
Mujhe Haalat Se Takraana Hai
Aise Haalat Mein Pee Lene Do
Abhi Zinda Hoon Toh Jee Lene Do
Jee Lene Do
Bhari Barsaat Mein Pee Lene Do
Aaj Ki Shaam Badi Bojhal Hai
Aaj Ki Raat Badi Kaatil Hai
Ho...
Aaj Ki Shaam Badi Bojhal Hai
Aaj Ki Raat Badi Kaatil Hai
Ho ...
Aaj Ki Shaam Dhalega Kaise
Aaj Ki Raat Kategi Kaise
Aag Se Aag Bujhegi Dil Ki
Aag Se Aag Bujhegi Dil Ki
Mujhe Yeh Aag Bhi Pee Lene Do
Abhi Zinda Hoon Toh Jee Lene Do
Jee Lene Do
Bhari Barsaat Main Pee Lene Do
Hmmm...
Barsaat Ke Mausam Mein
Hmmm...
Tanhai Ke Aalam Main

Lyrics:

Yeh Bhi Na Jaane
Woh Bhi Na Jaane
Naino Ke Rang Naina Jaane
Mila Jo Sang Tera
Uda Patang Mera
Hawa Mein Hoke Malang

Jag Ki Koi Reet Na Jaane
Main Toh Bas Teri Hui Deewani
Mila Jo Sang Tera
Uda Patang Mera
Hawa Mein Hoke Malang

Main Chhod Aayi Ghar Baar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Ab Tu Hi Hai Sansaar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Yeh Paagal Sa Hai Pyaar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Main Chhod Aayi Ghar Baar Mera
O Makhna...

Chhod Aayi Ghar Baar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Ab Tu Hi Hai Sansaar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Yeh Paagal Sa Hai Pyaar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Main Chhod Aayi Ghar Baar Mera
O Makhna...

Teri Hi Baatein Ho
Subah Si Raatein Ho
Jab Se Mila Hai Tu
Dil Ko Mila Sukoon
Tu Hi Raah Meri, Tu Hi Safar Hai
Teri Baahon Mein, Ab Mera Ghar Hai

Chain Na Jaane Dard Na Jaane
Dil Toh Bas Dil Ko Pehchaane
Mila Jo Sang Tera
Uda Patang Mera
Hawa Mein Hoke Malang

Main Chhod Aayi Ghar Baar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Ab Tu Hi Hai Sansaar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Yeh Paagal Sa Hai Pyaar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Main Chhod Aayi Ghar Baar Mera
O Makhna...

Chhod Aayi Ghar Baar Mera
Ab Tu Hi Hai Sansaar Mera
Yeh Paagal Sa Hai Pyaar Mera
Main Chhod Aayi Ghar Baar Mera
O Makhna...

Mmm....

Tu Hi Hai Sansaar Mera

Lyrics: 

[Verse 1]
Tu safar mera, hai tu hi meri manzil
Tere bina guzara, Ae dil hai mushkil
Tu mera khuda, Tu hi duaa main shaamil
Tere bina guzara, Ae dil hai mushkil
Mujhe azmaati hai teri kami
Meri har kami ko hai tu laazmi

[Chorus]
Junoon hai mera, Banu main tere kaabil
Tere bina guzaara, Ae dil hai mushkil

[Verse 2]
Ye rooh bhi meri, Ye jism bhi mera
Utna mera nahi, Jitna hua tera
Tune diya hai jo, Wo dard hi sahi
Tujhse mila hai to inaam hai mera
Mera aasmaan dhoondhe teri zameen
Meri har kami ko hai tu laazmi

[Chorus]
Zameen pe na sahi, To aasmaan mein aa mil
Tere bina guzaara, Ae dil hai mushkil

[Verse 3]
Maana ki teri maujoodgi se
Yeh zindagani mehroom hai
Jeene ka koi dooja tareeka
Na mere dil ko maloom hai
Tujhko main kitni shiddat se chaahun
Chahe toh rehna tu bekhabar
Mohtaj manzil ka toh nahi hai
Yeh ek tarfa mera safar safar
Khoobsurat hain manzil se bhi

[Chorus]
Meri har kami ko hai tu laazmi
Adhoora hoke bhi hai ishq mera kaamil
Tere bina guzara ae dil hai mushkil

🎤 Lyrics: Craig David - Insomnia

[Intro]
Jim Beanz, give it to me, oh baby I can't!

[Verse 1]
Never thought that I'd fall in love, love, love, love
But it grew from a simple crush, crush, crush, crush
Being without you girl, I was all messed up, up, up, up
When you walked out, said that you'd had enough-nough-nough

[Pre-Chorus]
Been a fool, girl, I know
Didn't expect this is how things would go
Maybe in time, you'll change your mind
Now looking back, I wish I could rewind

[Chorus]
Because I can't sleep 'til you're next to me
No, I can't live without you no more
Oh, I stay up 'til you're next to me
'Til this house feels like it did before

[Post-Chorus]
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah

[Verse 2]
Remember telling my boys that I'd never fall in love, love, love, love
You used to think I'd never find a girl I could trust, trust, trust, trust
And then you walked into my life and it was all about us, us, us, us
But now, I'm sitting here, thinking I messed the whole thing up, up, up, up

[Pre-Chorus]
Been a fool (fool), girl, I know (know)
Didn't expect this is how things would go
Maybe in time (time), you'll change your mind (mind)
Now looking back, I wish I could rewind

[Chorus]
Because I can't sleep 'til you're next to me
No, I can't live without you no more (without you no more)
Oh, I stay up 'til you're next to me (to me)
'Til this house feels like it did before

[Post-Chorus]
Because it feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah

[Bridge]
Ah, I just can't go to sleep
'Cause it feels like I've fallen for you
It's getting way too deep
And I know that it's love because
[Chorus]
I can't sleep 'til you're next to me
No, I can't live without you no more (without you no more)
Oh, I stay up 'til you're next to me (to me)
'Til this house feels like it did before

[Post-Chorus]
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah

Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah

I'M NOT CRAZY, I'M NOT BLIND 

I'M NOT CRAZY, I'M NOT BLIND!!

Tired and hangry (Picky Piggy: Wow!)
Don't care about ""You and Me"" (Bobby Bearhug: Oh boy...)

Frown!
Frown Everyday, no other way
To get some peace and quiet

Hate!
All of your happy games, and smiley ways
We don't enjoy it!
Why destroy it??

Floppy wants to sleep, and Icky won't eat
And Groddy hates you, Dogpressed is blue
Ignore that Wimpin Chicken' and Boring UniqueCorn
Dumb Dumbba Dumbbaphant, not much more...

Hey- what you mean not much more?

Lyrics | الكلمات

بتطلع عنفسيتي بتعرف فيني هم
وين بروح بحالي ارضي كلها سم
الصبر والقوة دافع حقن دم
زرعت ورد لناس ما بتعرف تشم

صفنت الشمعة ونزلت دمعة
بوقت الكل كسرني
مسحت الدمعة لأطفي الشمعة
القوة بذاتها رادتني
قلبي ياخدني ع طريقك
كلمة ب شِعري تشعل حريقك
عبوابك واقف حتى صيدك
حالف تتكوني من نصيبي

خيَّال خيَّال .. خيَّال خيَّال
رح تتحامي بظهر رجال
وانا من الباب والله ترحال 
فرس اصيلة وبدها خيال
و مخدرة هالبال
اصبر مابقدر من هالجمال
طالب ايدك انا بالحلال ..

وانا تشهدلي الأرض 
عدوي كان مرافقني فرض
حابس جوا قلبي الجراح
نشلتو وصار نقطة بالنرد

المعركة يلي بتفوت فيا .. 
يا بتنهيك ! يا بتنهيا !!

وأنا رح انهيا ..! حارقها باللي فيا ..!
مدمر بُكرة أبيها ..! جرح قلبي مخزن اذية ..!

وأنا رح انهيا ..! حارقها باللي فيا ..!
مدمر بُكرة أبيها ..! بنت قلبي هايا البنية ..!

بس من بعد فترة الضعف
رجعت خيال وايدي بالألف
تعد الكسرة وحدة وحدة وعالرف
كل عدة كانت ايدا والكف 
وتقلي على جرحي اصحى
والوجع صابني وقت الفرحة
كل كسرة تهدني بجبرها
وانا نفسي الله عاززها 

خيال .. خيال .. عشت عمري خيال
كاسر جناح طيري .. يضعف عندي مافي مجال !

خيال .. خيال .. عشت عمري خيال
لا ما رح شوفا لغيري .. وهيه بقلبي والله !",Odai - عدي,"أغاني عربية,أغاني عربية ٢٠٢٤,أغاني راب عربية ٢٠٢٤,new music,راب عربي,odai music,odai 2024,odai,عدي,عودي,oday,udai,جديد عدي,اجدد اغاني عدي,احدث اغاني عدي,عدي 2024,odai new,odai new song,Khyial,kyal,khyial,odai khyial,odai khyial 2024,خيال,وانا رح انهيا,حارقها باللي فيها,وانا تشهدلي الارض,المعركة يلي بتفوت فيها يا بتنهيك يا بتنهيا,فرس اصيلة,بوب,زرعت ورد لناس ما بتعرف تشم,كليب خيال",10,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music,2024-11-02T13:00:06Z,PT3M17S,5875348,5187,False,,

Kuchh Mithi Baaton Se
Kuchh Jhoothe Vaadon Se
Pakke Iraadon Se
Dil Ko Hai Churana

Rakh Loon Saja Ke Tujhe
Seene Se Laga Ke Aaja
Gale Lag Ja Gale Lag Ja

Khwaab Bana Ke Tujhe
Dil Mein Chupa Ke Rakhun
Mere Paas Aa Mere Paas Aa

Do Mulaqaton Mein
Kaali Yeh Raaton Mein
Baaton Hi Baaton Mein
Dil De Diya

Teri Baaton Mein

Synopsis:
India’s top agent Kabir (Hrithik Roshan) leads the Elite Shadow Unit of R&AW, a compact group of the crème de la crème of the armed forces who are personally trained by him and work with him on various high-risk missions across the world. Among Kabir and Colonel Luthra’s key targets are an international arms baron Rizwan Ilyasi who has been key in various acts of terrorism against the country. 

Khalid (Tiger Shroff) has fought his way up the ranks of the Indian armed forces. His greatest challenge and battle has been to fight against the sins of his father, once a decorated soldier working with Kabir who had turned a traitor. His ambition has been to join Kabir’s team to remove any stains on their family name. Kabir is not keen due to their past history, but Colonel Luthra requests him to, and gradually Kabir is also impressed by Khalid’s intense dedication and grit. Khalid becomes Kabir’s greatest soldier ever, flirting with death repeatedly in mission after mission as they go after the country’s enemies, including a mission against Rizwan Ilyasi that nearly kills Khalid. 

But Khalid’s greatest mission, his toughest yet, is still to come. When his own mentor Kabir turns rogue and starts to go after top officials and scientists and officers in the Indian establishment, targeting and executing them viciously across the world.  

Colonel Luthra is unsure if Khalid has it in him to go after Kabir. Is he clever enough to hunt the man who trained him, and even if he does get him, does he have it in him to put a bullet in his hero’s head? Luthra advises Khalid against the mission but he insists – he is the best protégé and the only one who can track the mentor. And only Kabir can answer the crucial question – why did he turn rogue? 

A vicious cat and mouse game ensues as protégé goes after mentor in a war that spills across the globe. As the chase unravels both Kabir and Khalid begin to finally realize, what desperate stakes really drive them in this terrifying war.

(Lyrics/Paroles):
Ils se demandent comment j'ai fait
Ils se demandent, hmm-hmm
Ils se demandent com-comment j'ai fait
Ils se demandent, ils-ils veulent pas prendre les mêmes risques que moi
Mais comment j'ai fait ?
Ils se demandent, ils me voient dans le féfé
Ils se demandent, télécommandés, ils sont télécommandés
Dépose ta batte, viens te battre (oh oui)
Si t'es cap, si t'es cap (oh oui)
Toi t'es bonne qu'à faire des captures (oh oui)
Tu m'épates, tu m'épates
Non je rigole
Dépose ta batte, viens te battre (oh oui)
Je vais te mettre à quatre pattes (oh oui)

Je vais, je vais te mettre à quatre pattes
Nan-nan-nan-nan-nan-nan
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Ils se demandent comment j'ai fait
Ils se demandent, hmm-hmm
Ils se demandent, com-comment j'ai fait
Ils se demandent, ils-ils veulent pas prendre les mêmes risques que moi
Mais comment j'ai fait ?
Ils se demandent, ils me voient dans le fé-fé
Ils se demandent, télécommandés, ils sont télécommandés
Ils se demandent

Qui a cru que j'allais faire du son
Eh, j'ai trop flairé regarde où je suis maintenant
Tout ce que je fais ça fonctionne

Et l'échec, c'est une condition de la réussite, hein
On est là comme on est
Si vous êtes les meilleurs, soyez les meilleurs
Peu importe ce que vous faites, croyez en vous
Bélièvre

Déposes ta batte, viens te battre
Je vais te mettre à quatre pattes
Je vais, je vais te mettre à quatre pattes
Nananananananana
La-ta-ta-ta-ta-ta

Pertemuan 2

Betapa hati tak bahagia
Bila kekasih yang lama kurindukan kini dia datang
Dia datang seperti dahulu
Setelah lama meninggalkan diriku sepi sendiri

Alangkah bahagia pertemuanku kali ini
Setelah berpisah sekian lamanya
Semoga selamanya dia berada di sisiku
Tiada pergi lagi tiada sunyi lagi

Sampai akhir nanti selalu berdua
Betapa hati tak bahagia
Bila kekasih yang lama kurindukan kini dia datang
Dia datang seperti dahulu
Setelah lama meninggalkan diriku sepi sendiri

*Lirik ‘Tak Sedalam Ini’ :*

Jangan kau obati luka ini
Biarkan mengalir darah tak henti
Ku tahu kau hanya membuat lukaku semakin perih
Kini kau datang, esok kau pergi
Seakan engkau tak punya hati

Terlalu aku mencintaimu
Rupanya kesempatan bagimu
Maafku untukmu berulang kali, tapi tiada arti
Kini denganku, esok dengannya
Aku tak sanggup lagi

Sakitnya, perihnya
Melihat kau bercumbu dengannya
Kau tega menyiksa
Aku yang selalu setia

Andai rasa di hati tak sedalam ini
Dari dahulu engkau tlah ku tinggalkan
Cinta yang ku miliki tak bisa kau bandingkan
Rugilah engkau kerna memilih dia

Terlalu aku mencintaimu
Rupanya kesempatan bagimu
Maafku untukmu berulang kali, tapi tiada arti
Kini denganku, esok dengannya
Aku tak sanggup lagi

Sakitnya, perihnya
Melihat kau bercumbu dengannya
Kau tega menyiksa
Aku yang selalu setia

Andai rasa di hati tak sedalam ini
Dari dahulu engkau tlah ku tinggalkan
Cinta yang ku miliki tak bisa kau bandingkan
Rugilah engkau kerna memilih dia

Lyrics: 

[Verse 1]
Tu safar mera, hai tu hi meri manzil
Tere bina guzara, Ae dil hai mushkil
Tu mera khuda, Tu hi duaa main shaamil
Tere bina guzara, Ae dil hai mushkil
Mujhe azmaati hai teri kami
Meri har kami ko hai tu laazmi

[Chorus]
Junoon hai mera, Banu main tere kaabil
Tere bina guzaara, Ae dil hai mushkil

[Verse 2]
Ye rooh bhi meri, Ye jism bhi mera
Utna mera nahi, Jitna hua tera
Tune diya hai jo, Wo dard hi sahi
Tujhse mila hai to inaam hai mera
Mera aasmaan dhoondhe teri zameen
Meri har kami ko hai tu laazmi

[Chorus]
Zameen pe na sahi, To aasmaan mein aa mil
Tere bina guzaara, Ae dil hai mushkil

[Verse 3]
Maana ki teri maujoodgi se
Yeh zindagani mehroom hai
Jeene ka koi dooja tareeka
Na mere dil ko maloom hai
Tujhko main kitni shiddat se chaahun
Chahe toh rehna tu bekhabar
Mohtaj manzil ka toh nahi hai
Yeh ek tarfa mera safar safar
Khoobsurat hain manzil se bhi

[Chorus]
Meri har kami ko hai tu laazmi
Adhoora hoke bhi hai ishq mera kaamil
Tere bina guzara ae dil hai mushkil

Sekti

Sayang, sawangen rembulan kae
Sumunar, nyawang aku ro kowe

Sayang, yakino wes ora suwe
Sesandingan, aku jejer ro kowe
Senadyan wong tuo rung marengke

Ombak gedhe tak sebrangi
Banjir bandhang tak tataki
Penting aku kowe iso dadi siji

Gunung njebluk tak jak ngopi
Segoro gheni tak nggo nglangi
Opo maneh mung ngelawan bapakmu kuwi

Mesti tak ladeni...

Sayang, sawangen rembulan kae
Sumunar, nyawang aku ro kowe

Oh.. Sayang, yakino wes ora suwe
Sesandingan, aku jejer ro kowe
Senadyan wong tuo rung marengke

Ombak gedhe tak sebrangi
Banjir bandhang tak tataki
Penting aku kowe iso dadi siji

Gunung njebluk tak jak ngopi
Segoro gheni tak nggo nglangi
Opo maneh mung ngelawan bapakmu kuwi

Ombak gedhe tak sebrangi
Banjir bandhang tak tataki
Penting aku kowe iso dadi siji

Gunung njebluk tak jak ngopi
Segoro gheni tak nggo nglangi
Opo maneh mung ngelawan bapakmu kuwi

Mesti tak ladeni...

(Lyrics/Paroles):
[Intro : tag]
S/o le Flem, han

[Refrain]
J'suis bloqué dans sa tête, c'est moi contre elle, en un contre un
Mon partenaire d'enfer, c'est top secret, c'est sous contrat
J'suis confiant, si ça pète, c'est sûr que personne racontera
Elle est as-p dans les nanani naninana (Nani nanina)

[Couplet 1]
Faut qu'j'pense à moi avant d'penser à nous (Penser à nous), y a que allongé que j'donne de l'amour (De l'amour)
Et sans la monnaie, j'ai même plus d'humour (Plus d'humour), tout comme ton henné, j'serai plus là un jour
Du mal (Du mal), j'te f'rai et ça m'déplaît, t'es mon secret dans mon game play (Hey)
J'ai des jouets, j'ai mon bulletproof, bae, dans la gue-dro, y a pour tous les goûts
J'irai dehors parce que faut les sous, nan, j'pourrai pas être présent tous les jours
J'ai mal (J'ai mal), je serre, que j'me resserre, Barça ou Rotter', que des gros tehs

[Refrain]
J'suis bloqué dans sa tête, c'est moi contre elle, en un contre un
Mon partenaire d'enfer, c'est top secret, c'est sous contrat
J'suis confiant, si ça pète, c'est sûr que personne racontera
Elle est as-p dans les nanani naninana (Nani nanina)

[Couplet 2]
J'protège ton trône (J'protège ton trône), queen, soit décontracte (Soit décontracte)
Jusqu'à l'overdose (Jusqu'à l'overdose) quand on s'recontacte (On s'recontacte)
J'en raconte trop (Faut qu'j'me taise) mais c'est sous contrôle (Baby)
J'sens qu'l'amour me frôle (Pour de vrai) quand elle m'épaule (Quand elle m'épaule, bloqué dans sa—)

[Refrain]
J'suis bloqué dans sa tête, c'est moi contre elle, en un contre un
Mon partenaire d'enfer, c'est top secret, c'est sous contrat
J'suis confiant, si ça pète, c'est sûr que personne racontera
Elle est as-p dans les nanani naninana (Nani nanina)

ناري و رمادي
زرعي و حصادي
ننزف وانا جلّادي

جرحي و مدادي
حزني و فؤادي
قرّبت و زاد بعادي

كانو احلامي
بساط و غير قدامي
طارو كيف حمامي
و ما ردولي سلامي

جمعت حطامي
اللي بنيت بيه اصنامي
و مشيت فظلامي
وحداني فزحامي

بين الناس انا وحداني
ما بقيت نفهم حتى لساني
انا فمرايتي برّاني

انا المرتاح فعذابي
و نزيد السم فشرابي
انا اللي حربي فقلبي كلّو ضرابي و عقلي ارهابي

و دعي يا يما
باش تزول الغمة
انت النور اللي بقالي و الباقي غير ظلمة
وانا قلبي يا يما ، قلبي فيه مجزرة
و مشاعر غـدّارة كلّ مرة كارة

ناري و رمادي
زرعي و حصادي
ننزف وانا جلّادي

جرحي و مدادي
حزني و فؤادي
قرّبت و زاد بعادي

كانو احلامي
بساط و غير قدامي
طارو كيف حمامي
و ما ردولي سلامي

جمعت حطامي
اللي بنيت بيه اصنامي
و مشيت فظلامي
وحداني فزحامي

انا الطير اللي قزّبت جناحي
انا المحبوس اللي ما بغيت نطلق سراحي
انا المجروح اللي كنتلذذ بجراحي
انا الفنان اللي ترقصو على نواحي

ياك النيران نيراني
دخاني من بركاني
غني معايا على احزاني و راسي اللي نساني و قلبي اللي بكّاني

انا القاضي و المحامي
واللي حكمت بإعدامي
حتى دوايا فسقامي نحب انفصامي و عذابو فخصامي

ناري و رمادي
زرعي و حصادي
ننزف وانا جلّادي

جرحي و مدادي
حزني و فؤادي
قرّبت و زاد بعادي

كانو احلامي
بساط و غير قدامي
طارو كيف حمامي
و ما ردولي سلامي

جمعت حطامي
اللي بنيت بيه اصنامي
و مشيت فظلامي
وحداني فزحامي

Dunyo shunchalar qimmatmi?
Shu pulsiz zulmatmi?
Boylik — eng ulugʻ ne’matmi?
Yoʻqmi inson qiymati?!

Oʻylab qolaman, oʻtkinchi olam,
Mol-dunyoga buncha oʻch bu odam?
Choʻntak boʻsh boʻlsa bosma qadam,
Mensimasdan qarar koʻz qiridan.

Sezmay qolaman, aldaydi odam,
Qoʻrqmaydi, harom non yer hiyladan.
Maqsad — sotish, hatto sotuvda badan,
Tavba qil, qoʻrq olov taftidan.

Unutma, ey inson, bu — foniy dunyo,
Boʻlma razil, tushdamassan, bu — roʻyo.
Oʻylaysan hammasi yaxshidek goʻyo,
Sen sabab yo haq, yo nohaq bu dunyo.

Tuzilgan shunaqa “qora dastur”,
Piyodasan, yoʻqmi moshina — ozgina past tur.
Boy kasal boʻlsa, doʻxtirlar hammasi gʻamxoʻr,
Kambagʻalning joni ogʻrisa, “Navbatda jim tur!”

Boʻlsa boldi bitta yangi iPhone,
Oʻtdi vaqt maqsadsiz, doim birga shayton.
Qora Gentra, 3-4 soʻm pul, ol senga maydon,
Tulki, boʻri, ilon — oʻzi shularmi hayvon? 

Dunyo shunchalar qimmatmi?
Shu pulsiz zulmatmi?
Boylik — eng ulugʻ ne’matmi?
Yoʻqmi inson qiymati?! (2x)

Tan olaman, koʻp narsa bogʻliq pulga,
Suzmayman, mayli, qarshi oqimga.
Kechib ketdi bir chaqa deb, ogʻir botdi dilga,
Bor bogʻliq narsalar — pulgamas, koʻngilga. 

Aytaman bitta gapni oʻsha boy zoʻrlarga,
Savol-javob bitta joyda, sen va pulga zorlarga.
Sevgandim — berishmadi, doʻstman qora tunlarga,
Yor-yor bilan ketdi qasri borlarga.

Oʻylab qolaman, oʻtkinchi olam,
Mol-dunyoga buncha oʻch bu odam?
Choʻntak boʻsh boʻlsa bosma qadam,
Mensimasdan qarar koʻz qiridan.

Dunyo shunchalar qimmatmi?
Shu pulsiz zulmatmi?
Boylik — eng ulugʻ ne’matmi?
Yoʻqmi inson qiymati?!

Letra/Lyrics: 
Jajaja
Maluma, ba-ba-baby

[Pre-Coro]
Te vi en la disco perreando con otro
Pero pusieron el disco que era de nosotros
Me miraste a los ojos, te reíste
Ya con eso todo me dijiste
Pensaba que me superaste porque no volviste

[Coro]
Al parecer la baby no me olvidó, sigue pendiente
Quiere ignorarme, pero es que la tensión se ve, se siente
Si le pregunta' que si ya me olvidó y dice que sí, te miente
No es un secreto que entre ella y yo quedaron cosas pendiente'
Al parecer la baby no me olvidó, sigue pendiente
Quiere ignorarme, pero es que la tensión se ve, se siente
Si le pregunta' que si ya me olvidó y dice que sí, te miente
No es un secreto que entre ella y yo quedaron cosas pendientes

Quedaron cosas pendiente'
Una noche caliente, una cena romántica (Sí)
¿Por qué me ves diferente?
Delante 'e la gente te hace' la antipática (Ah)
Quieres quedar como la buena, mami
Tú sabe' que eso sigue siendo pa' mí
Mirando fotos, en las tuya' caí
Y no te niego, cariñito me di (Me di)
No sé por qué lo intentaste con el siguiente
Si para superarme no está preparada
La huella que te dejé sigue permanente
Como tatuaje, eso ya no lo borra nada
¿Será que te hago falta, bebé?
Que él no te llena' con na'
Que me olvidaste juré

Y al parecer la baby no me olvidó, sigue pendiente
Quiere ignorarme, pero es que la tensión se ve, se siente
Si le pregunta' que si ya me olvidó y dice que sí, te miente
No es un secreto que entre ella y yo quedaron cosas pendientes
Jaja
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Maluma, ba-ba-baby, jaja
+PRETTY +DIRTY
Mamacita, I know you miss me, jaja
Mua

Lyrics:

[Verse 1]
We're talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, okay?

[Chorus]
Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

[Verse 2]
So, needless to say
I'm odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is okay
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry

[Chorus]
Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Oh, things that you say, yeah
Is it life or just to play my worries away?
You're all the things I've got to remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

[Chorus]
Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day

[Outro]
(Take on me) (Take on me)
(Take me on) (Take on me)
I'll be gone (Take on me) (Take on me)
In a day (Take me on) (Take on me)
(Take on me) (Take on me)
(Take me on) (Take on me)

LYRICS
Me more me qaf me more
Ma bere jeten malore
O te dua o s'te dua
Kshu me merzit ti mua.

Me thuaj dy fjale te embla
Tepelena s'duron dengla
Me lodhen nazet e tua
Kshu me merzit ti mua.

Te dua qene te dua
afrohu nje here tek mua
Te dua qene te dua
Betohem per syte e tua
Aaaaa kshu me merzit mua.

REFRENI
Te marrte lumi 
lume edhe perrua
Kur s'me hedh syte moj
Kshu me merzit mua.

Jeten ti moj ma ke nxirre
Nuk me the nje fjale te mire
Here do molle e here do ftua
Kshu me merzit ti mua.

Se ma thone dy syte e tu
Ndaj akoma jam ketu
Ah kjo zemer mu merua
Kshu me merzit ti mua.

TRANSLATION:
O BABY , THIS IS A JATT CLAN 
FULLY TAKING THE VICTORY CLAN
IN YOUR CITY, THERE IS FEAR OF YOUR LOVER
CLAN IS TAKING OVER FIERCELY
WE GO BEYOND IMAGINATION 
WITH THOSE FRIENDS WHO WALK ALONG
RUNNING BLACK BUSINESSES 
AND WE NEVER GIVE A DAMN, CLAN
 
O BABY , THIS IS A JATT CLAN 
FULLY TAKING THE VICTORY CLAN
IN YOUR CITY, THERE IS FEAR OF YOUR LOVER
CLAN IS TAKING OVER FIERCELY

O BABY , THIS IS A JATT CLAN 
FULLY TAKING THE VICTORY CLAN
IN YOUR CITY, THERE IS FEAR OF YOUR LOVER
CLAN IS TAKING OVER FIERCELY

THE FRIENDSHIP OF A JATT IS STRONG WITH BRAHMIN BROTHERS 
THE BLACK CADDY IS JATT’S LUCKY ONE
WE GET THREATS DAILY 
JATT’S EYES ARE FULLY SUSPICIOUS
IN THE MORNING, WE GOT OUR DOSE EARLY
PICKED UP FRIENDS AND BROTHERS ALONG
RELOADED THE CHAMBER WITH ROUNDS
WHO WILL DARE TO STOP THE CLAN

O BABY , THIS IS A JATT CLAN 
FULLY TAKING THE VICTORY CLAN
IN YOUR CITY, THERE IS FEAR OF YOUR LOVER
CLAN IS TAKING OVER FIERCELY

UNDERSTOOD THEIR MOVES
I DIDN’T GET ATTACHED
THEY TRIED TO TAME ME 
BUT I WASN’T CAPTURED
THE SAME FRIENDS TURNED TRAITORS 
WITH THOSE I COULDN’T CASH IN

MY SILENCE STILL BOTHERS THEM TODAY
MY MEMORIES STILL MAKE THEM CRY 
THEY KEEP PLAYING GROUP POLITICS
BUT MY RISE STILL DRIVES THEM CRAZY

KEEPING THEM ON TOES
HOW CAN THEY SIT DOWN
THEY DON’T HAVE PATIENCE EVEN FOR A MOMENT
HOW WILL THE TAKE THIS?
YOU CAN’T BUY CLASS WITH MONEY
WHERE WILL THEY GET TO MY LEVEL?

MY WEAPONS AND MAGAZINE ARE SITTING ON THE DASHBOARD,
PICKED UP A COUPLE OF FERRARIS WITH CASH.
THEY'RE IN YOUR CITY, BUSY WITH WORK,
AND I'M HERE CHILLING, LIVING IN LUXURY.

O BABY , THIS IS A JATT CLAN 
FULLY TAKING THE VICTORY CLAN
IN YOUR CITY, THERE IS FEAR OF YOUR LOVER
CLAN IS TAKING OVER FIERCELY
WE GO BEYOND IMAGINATION 
WITH THOSE FRIENDS WHO WALK ALONG
RUNNING BLACK BUSINESSES 
AND WE NEVER GIVE A DAMN, CLAN
 
O BABY , THIS IS A JATT CLAN 
FULLY TAKING THE VICTORY CLAN
IN YOUR CITY, THERE IS FEAR OF YOUR LOVER
CLAN IS TAKING OVER FIERCELY

O BABY , THIS IS A JATT CLAN 
FULLY TAKING THE VICTORY CLAN
IN YOUR CITY, THERE IS FEAR OF YOUR LOVER
CLAN IS TAKING OVER FIERCELY

Been quiet for a few months while we cooked this song along side other projects but it’s finally here! “Play My Way”, a song Co-written with my friend RecD, is a semi-sequel to “Don’t Listen” has arrived and has a music video in production too! I say semi since the contents of this song are explicitly based on those official Amanda pilot shorts we had been doing to help tease the game instead of contents from the sequel. (Though it’s amazing how many things in this song and that are planned for the music video that actually line up with the second game 🤭)

Honored to have the original voice of Amanda (Blair Greene-Osako) singing lead on this track, she performed amazing and we should all give her a round of applause!

Super happy to say Meelz returns to help deliver a spectacular guitar performance, and Toastymarshmellow is snuck in performing in the choir and backup vocals with JoshucaVA and Kathy-Chan!

Hope you all enjoy this second dive into Amanda’s musical universe!

Lyrics:

Hi my name’s Amanda
What’s your name?
Oh that sounds familiar…
Have we played this game?
 
Where one person hides and
You’ve gotta go find them
I’m looking for my friend
Wait, you think you see him?


In this tree, in this box
that’s a good hiding spot
gotta get this done
so we can have more fun!

Hey look, you found me!
I guess it’s my turn huh?

Or we could play another game! Maybe tag—
Wait amanda! I haven’t gotten a turn… can’t we just do one more round of hide n seek?
I guess… that’s only fair…


1 2 3 4
Uh… What comes next?
2 3 4 5
Oh right, you’re the best!
6 7 8 9
You must play this a lot
7 8 9 10
So ready or not 
Here I come?…

Oh no!
She could be anywhere!
Do you see Amanda?



Now watch us play our part
Now watch us dance and sing
Don’t want to fall apart
Like kids who never seem to scream

We get to play all day
But can we play my way
Got another game
So can you try it with me

(Close your eyes
Count to ten
Will you help me find my friend
Is she here
Is she there
I can’t find her anywhere)


Amanda Amanda!
Oh…
Amanda Amanda!




Hi my name’s Amanda
Oh hi it’s you again
We’re playing Hide n Seek
Seems like it never ends

Isn’t it getting boring?
We’d have more fun today
If we try something else
put hide and seek away 

I’ve been thinking
how we play tag
when i say YOU’RE IT!
and i run in zig zag
could we be happy
If we make believe
(Amanda.)
That we have a choice
What you play with me
(Amanda… Amanda!)

I’m ready to play it
I’m ready to-
(Amanda!)
WHAT
I know that you’re wanting to play tag but
It’s my turn now.
It’s MY turn now!
IT’s mY turN now!
IT’S MY TURN NOW!!— 


I WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING ELSE




Now watch us play our part
Now watch us dance and sing
Don’t let it break your heart
Just play along and never scream
AAAA 
We get to play all day
But can we play my way
Got another game
So can you try it with me



1 2 3 4
Is she just past this bush
2 3 4 5
or behind this old tree
6 7 8 9
I don’t think she’s down there
7 8 9 10
Please you must trust me
1 2 3 4
I don’t wanna go in there
2 3 4 5
I don’t wanna go in there
6 7 8 9
I don’t wanna go
7 8 9 10

(I don’t wanna go
I just wanna play my way
I don’t wanna go
I just wanna go home)

H-huh?... gasp

Looks like you found silly mister… FOX!!
AAAAAAAA



Now watch him fall apart
Now watch him gush and bleed
He had a beating heart
That ended with a little scream!
Now we can play all day 
And we will play my way 
made my own game 
So can you try it with me

Now watch us rip apart
Now watch us dance agape
Puppets with beating hearts
And strings made of magnetic tape 
We're cursed to play all day 
But never play our way 
Is there another game 
and could you try it for me




*giggling till sighing*


(Close your eyes
Count to ten
Will you help me find my friend
Is she here
Is she there
I can’t find her anywhere)

Lyrics | الكلمات

بتطلع عنفسيتي بتعرف فيني هم
وين بروح بحالي ارضي كلها سم
الصبر والقوة دافع حقن دم
زرعت ورد لناس ما بتعرف تشم

صفنت الشمعة ونزلت دمعة
بوقت الكل كسرني
مسحت الدمعة لأطفي الشمعة
القوة بذاتها رادتني
قلبي ياخدني ع طريقك
كلمة ب شِعري تشعل حريقك
عبوابك واقف حتى صيدك
حالف تتكوني من نصيبي

خيَّال خيَّال .. خيَّال خيَّال
رح تتحامي بظهر رجال
وانا من الباب والله ترحال 
فرس اصيلة وبدها خيال
و مخدرة هالبال
اصبر مابقدر من هالجمال
طالب ايدك انا بالحلال ..

وانا تشهدلي الأرض 
عدوي كان مرافقني فرض
حابس جوا قلبي الجراح
نشلتو وصار نقطة بالنرد

المعركة يلي بتفوت فيا .. 
يا بتنهيك ! يا بتنهيا !!

وأنا رح انهيا ..! حارقها باللي فيا ..!
مدمر بُكرة أبيها ..! جرح قلبي مخزن اذية ..!

وأنا رح انهيا ..! حارقها باللي فيا ..!
مدمر بُكرة أبيها ..! بنت قلبي هايا البنية ..!

بس من بعد فترة الضعف
رجعت خيال وايدي بالألف
تعد الكسرة وحدة وحدة وعالرف
كل عدة كانت ايدا والكف 
وتقلي على جرحي اصحى
والوجع صابني وقت الفرحة
كل كسرة تهدني بجبرها
وانا نفسي الله عاززها 

خيال .. خيال .. عشت عمري خيال
كاسر جناح طيري .. يضعف عندي مافي مجال !

OFFICIAL LOUD SONG LYRICS:  

It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
(Share the love) 

I don't wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can't stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
With you, shawty, with you
With you, shawty, with you
With you, under the mistletoe

Everyone's gathering around the fire
Chestnuts roasting like a hot July
I should be chilling with my folks, I know
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
Word on the street, Santa's coming tonight
Reindeer's flying through the sky so high
I should be making a list, I know
But I'ma be under the mistletoe

With you, shawty, with you
With you, shawty, with you
With you, under the mistletoe
With you, shawty, with you
With you, shawty, with you
With you, under the mistletoe

Ayy, love, the wise men followed the star (the wise men followed the star)
The way I followed my heart
And it led me to a miracle
Ayy, love (ayy, love), don't you buy me nothing (don't you buy me nothing)
'Cause I am feeling one thing, your lips on my lips
That's a merry, merry Christmas

It's the most beautiful time of the year
Lights fill the streets, spreading so much cheer
I should be playing in the winter snow (I know)
But I'ma be under the mistletoe
I don't wanna miss out on the holiday
But I can't stop staring at your face
I should be playing in the winter snow
